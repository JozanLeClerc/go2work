go2work
-------

go2work is a small command-line program to help you get up in the morning
so you can work. You can set custom ringtones and get a cool fortune too.
It is very inspired from shalarm (https://github.com/jahendrie/shalarm).
I made go2work originally to learn the Go programming language and also
because shalarm didn't work out of the box on FreeBSD.

go2work has several options and is configurable though a configuration file.
Refer to
    $ man go2work
to get a list of all options.

Dependencies
------------
- Go
- GNU Make
- fortune (optional)

Installation
------------
You can get go2work through git and build it from source. The installation
is straight forward:
    $ git clone git://jozanofastora.xyz/jozan/go2work.git
    $ cd go2work
    $ sudo make install clean

Note that on BSD systems you want to use gmake instead of make:
    $ sudo gmake install clean

Configuration and usage
-----------------------
Here is the default configuration file path:
    /usr/local/etc/go2work/go2work.toml

It is recommanded to copy it right away to:
    /home/your_name/.config/go2work/go2work.toml

go2work will search for configuration files in this order of importance:
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/go2work/go2work.toml
    $HOME/.config/go2work/go2work.toml
    /usr/local/etc/go2work/go2work.toml

Here are some examples of usage.
It is highly recommanded to test your configuration first, unless you
intentionally plan on not waking up. To run a test, use:
    $ go2work -t

To stop the alarm, use Ctrl + C to abort the program. If your ringtone is
done playing, it will play again until you wake the fuck up and insert a
Ctrl + C event into go2work.

Given time must always be in 24 hours format because it just is better than 12.
When planning to wake up at 06:30 A.M. use:
    $ go2work 06:30

or this will work as well:
    $ go2work 6:30

But when planning on waking up at 06:30 P.M. use:
    $ go2work 18:30

When minutes don't matter, for example setting the alarm at 10:00,
you can format the time as:
    $ go2work 10:00

or this is valid too:
    $ go2work 10:

However, this will give you an error:
    $ go2work 10

Time must be formatted somewhat properly.

Remaining time before the alarm rings is being displayed to confirm
that go2work is engaged.

Uninstall
---------
If you are unhappy with go2work because you don't like to work,
navigate to the go2work/ directory and run the following command:
    $ sudo make uninstall

Or on BSD systems with gmake:
    $ sudo gmake uninstall

End note
--------
Go is fun to learn and play with. I might continue developping go2work in
the future by adding a full TUI and more options but this is uncertain.

Please note that go2work was tested only on FreeBSD and Linux at the
moment. macOS is not supported but should work just fine, Windows probably won't
work at all. You can report any bug at bousset.rudy@gmail.com or on GitHub at
https://github.com/JozanLeClerc/go2work/issues.

Thanks for checking go2work.
